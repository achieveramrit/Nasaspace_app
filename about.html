    <h1>Solar System Facts</h1>
    <p>Our solar system is made up of a star, eight planets, and thousands of smaller bodies including dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.</p><br>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The solar system includes the Sun, eight planets, five officially named dwarf planets, and hundreds of moons, and thousands of asteroids and comets. Our solar system is located in the Orion Spur of the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy that's about 100,000 light years across.</p>
    <h3>Namesake</h3>
    <p>Our planetary system is called “the solar system” because we use the word “solar” to describe things related to our star, after the Latin word for Sun, "solis."</p>
    <h3>Potential for Life   </h3>
    <p>So far, we've only know about life on Earth, but NASA is searching for life on other worlds in our solar system and beyond.</p>
    <h3>Size and Distance</h3>
    <p>Our solar system extends much farther than the planets that orbit the Sun. The solar system also includes the Kuiper Belt that lies past Neptune's orbit. This is a ring of icy bodies, almost all smaller than the most popular Kuiper Belt Object  dwarf planet Pluto.

        Beyond the fringes of the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud. This giant spherical shell surrounds our solar system. It has never been directly observed, but its existence is predicted based on mathematical models and observations of comets that likely originate there.
        
        The Oort Cloud is made of icy pieces of space debris - some bigger than mountains – orbiting our Sun as far as 1.6 light-years away. This shell of material is thick, extending from 5,000 astronomical units to 100,000 astronomical units. One astronomical unit (or AU) is the distance from the Sun to Earth, or about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).</p>
    <h3>Moons</h3>
    <p>Our solar system has hundreds of moons orbiting planets, dwarf planets, and asteroids.

        Of the eight planets, Mercury and Venus are the only ones with no moons, although Venus does have a quasi-satellite that has officially been named Zoozve. 
        
        The giant planets Jupiter and Saturn lead our solar system’s moon counts. In some ways, the swarms of moons around these worlds resemble mini versions of our solar system.
        
        Pluto, smaller than our own moon, has five moons in its orbit, including Charon, a moon so large it makes Pluto wobble.</p>
